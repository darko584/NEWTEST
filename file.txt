When the TV comes on all by itself
Switching channels, losing signal
That's how I know when you're around
You mess, you mess with my head
Playing games so sick and twisted
Just to hear me call for help
I'll wait for you to let me go
Can't wait for you to let me go
But you won't
So I'll reclaim my body and my soul
Banish the broken from my bones
You're no longer my religion
So I take on a whole new energy
Manifest a better part of me
Gotta rid you from my system
It's time for an exorcism
When the phone rings,
the entire room goes cold
I find myself choking on tears and
Makeshift nooses from the telephone chord
And your voice, it's like nails on a chalkboard
Every time you speak my knees go weak
And I fall halfway out the door
I'll wait for you to let me go
Can't wait for you to let me go
But you won't
So I'll reclaim my body and my soul
Banish the broken from my bones
You're no longer my religion
So I take on a whole new energy
Manifest a better part of me
Gotta rid you from my system
It's time for an exorcism
It's time for an exorcism. 4x
And it starts right now, and it starts right now
I would rather die than with you inside,
gotta pull you out
And it starts right now, and it starts right now
I would rather die than with you inside, gotta pull you out
So I'll reclaim my body and my soul
Banish the broken from my bones
You're no longer my religion
So I take on a whole new energy
Manifest a better part of me
Gotta rid you from my system
It's time for an exorcism
